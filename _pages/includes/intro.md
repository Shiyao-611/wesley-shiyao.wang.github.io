## 📝 Introduction
I graduated from [Elite Program in Economics](http://econ.ruc.edu.cn/zsyx/zyjjxrcdyl/jjxbjxspyjd/808bffee72094ddd83b6c11c605ccc47.htm), Renmin University of China (中国人民大学) with bachelor's degrees in Economics and Mathematics. I am now an MS student at the Department of Computer Science jointly with Harris School of Public Policy, the University of Chicago(芝加哥大学). At Uchicago, I collaborate with [Xuechunzi Bai (白雪纯子)](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/Xuechunzi-Bai) and [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/). Prior to UChicago, I worked with  [Junjian Yi (易君健)](https://sites.google.com/view/junjianyi) at the Peking University National School of Development, where I used machine learning tools to analyze gender bias in civil servant recruitment. 


## 💡 Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of **behavioral science** and **computational methods**. Currently, I focus on the following 2 lines:

- Natural and Societal Shocks to Human Behaviors
I study how large-scale **exogenous shocks** (i.e. natural disasters, social policy) affect human behavior and decision-making. This line of research aims to understand the behavioral responses to unanticipated shocks.

- Computational Methods to Social Cognition  
I use **computational methods**, particularly **natural language processing (NLP)**, to examine how **social perceptions** and **stereotypes** evolve over time. This line of work investigates what drives these shifts in thought and behavior.

- Human–AI Interaction  
I further plan to explore how emerging **AI technologies** reshape human behavior, cognition, and social norms.
