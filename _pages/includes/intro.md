## 📝 Introduction
I graduated from [Elite Program in Economics](http://econ.ruc.edu.cn/zsyx/zyjjxrcdyl/jjxbjxspyjd/808bffee72094ddd83b6c11c605ccc47.htm), Renmin University of China (中国人民大学) with bachelor's degrees in Economics and Mathematics. I am now an MS student at the Department of Computer Science jointly with Harris School of Public Policy, the University of Chicago(芝加哥大学). At Uchicago, I collaborate with [Xuechunzi Bai (白雪纯子)](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/Xuechunzi-Bai) and [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/). Prior to UChicago, I worked with  [Junjian Yi (易君健)](https://sites.google.com/view/junjianyi) at the Peking University National School of Development, where I used machine learning tools to analyze gender bias in civil servant recruitment. 


## 💡 Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of **behavioral science** and **computational methods**. Currently, I focus on the following 2 lines:

- Causal inference

I study how large-scale **exogenous shocks—such as natural disasters, childhood adverse experiences, and social policies**—causally shape human behaviors and decision-making. My research leverages causal inference methods to uncover how these shocks contribute to social inequalities and biases.

- Computational Methods and Social Perception  
I use **computational methods**, particularly **natural language processing (NLP)**, to examine how **social perceptions** and **stereotypes** evolve over time. This line of work seeks to uncover the origins that shape and sustain changes in human beliefs.
