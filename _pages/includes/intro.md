I graduated from [Elite Program in Economics](http://econ.ruc.edu.cn/zsyx/zyjjxrcdyl/jjxbjxspyjd/808bffee72094ddd83b6c11c605ccc47.htm), Renmin University of China (中国人民大学) with bachelor's degrees in Economics and Mathematics. I am now an MS student at the Department of Computer Science jointly with Harris School of Public Policy, the University of Chicago(芝加哥大学). I collaborate with [Xuechunzi Bai (白雪纯子)](https://www.xuechunzibai.com/) and [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of behavioral science, computational methods, and societal change. Specifically, I am now focusing on three areas:

Natural and Societal Shocks: I study how large-scale exogenous shocks, such as natural disasters affect human behavior and decision-making. 

Computational Approaches to Social Cognition: I use computational methods, especially natural language processing (NLP), to investigate how social perceptions and stereotypes change over time, and what drives these shifts in human thought and behavior.

Human–AI Interaction: I explore how emerging AI technologies reshape human behavior, cognition, and social norms, with a focus on both intended and unintended consequences.
