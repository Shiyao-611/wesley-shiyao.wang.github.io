## Introduction
I graduated from [Elite Program in Economics](http://econ.ruc.edu.cn/zsyx/zyjjxrcdyl/jjxbjxspyjd/808bffee72094ddd83b6c11c605ccc47.htm), Renmin University of China (中国人民大学) with bachelor's degrees in Economics and Mathematics. I am now an MS student at the Department of Computer Science jointly with Harris School of Public Policy, the University of Chicago(芝加哥大学). I collaborate with [Xuechunzi Bai (白雪纯子)](https://www.xuechunzibai.com/) and [Joshua Jackson](https://www.joshuaconradjackson.com/). 

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of **behavioral science** and **computational methods**. Currently, I focus on the following three areas:

### 1. Natural and Societal Shocks to Human Behaviors
I study how large-scale **exogenous shocks** (i.e. natural disasters) affect human behavior and decision-making. This line of research aims to understand the behavioral responses to unanticipated disruptions in social and environmental contexts.

### 2. Computational Methods to Social Cognition  
I use **computational methods**, particularly **natural language processing (NLP)**, to examine how **social perceptions** and **stereotypes** evolve over time. My work investigates what drives these shifts in thought and behavior, contributing to our understanding of belief formation and culture change.

### 3. Human–AI Interaction  
I explore how emerging **AI technologies** reshape human behavior, cognition, and social norms. This is my future research plan.
